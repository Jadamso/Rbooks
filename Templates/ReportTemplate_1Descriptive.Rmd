```{r}
library(reactable)
reactable(Grunfeld[,c('firm','year','value')],
    groupBy='firm', 
    defaultPageSize=5)
```

# Descriptive Statistics
***

Summarize 2 variables from your dataset using

* Figures for accuracy
* Numbers for precision
* Words for the big-picture interpretation

```{r}
# Simple analysis first
# Then polish figures, making them interactive when helpful
```

# Replication Info 
***

```{r, eval=F}
sessionInfo()
