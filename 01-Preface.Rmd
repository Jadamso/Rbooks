# Preface {#index}

This book contains the following primers that should get you going with R in econometrics research

 * *Part   I*: Introduction to R
 * *Part  II*: Introduction to Regression Analysis in R
 * *Part III*: Introduction to Reproducible Research in R
 * *Part  IV*: Intermediate R

Much of the R-programming material (I, III, IV) was copied or modified from elsewhere, especially https://r4ds.had.co.nz/ and https://adv-r.hadley.nz/ but also many other sources I have found online and elsewhere over the years. I include references when I remembered to.

Much of Part II was also copied from elsewhere, although this section has more skeptical view towards what we can say with linear models. I also include a novel chapter on `Data scientism' that illustrates some of the limits to econometric analysis and ways it can mislead rather than illuminate.
