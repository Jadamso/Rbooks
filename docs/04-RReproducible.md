# (PART) Introduction to Reproducible R {-} 

# Why be reproducible 
***

It is in your own self-interest.  

## An example workflow

Taking First Steps ...

**Step 1: Some Ideas and Data**

$X_{1} \to Y_{1}$

* You copy some data into a spreadsheet
* do some calculations and tables the same spreadsheet
* some other analysis from here and there, using this software and that.

**Step 2: Persuing the lead for a week or two**

* you beef up the data you got
* add some other types of data 
* copy in a spreadsheet data, manually aggregate
* do some more calculations and tables, same as before




Then, a Little Way Down the Road ...

**1 month later, someone asks about another factor:** $X_{2}$

* You repeat **Step 2** with some data on $X_{2}$.
* The details from your "point and click" method are a bit fuzzy.

It takes a little time, but you successfully redo the analysis.


**4 months later, someone asks about another factor:** $X_{3}\to Y_{1}$

* You again repeat **Step 2** with some data on $X_{3}$.
* You're pretty sure
  * it's the latest version of the spreadsheet.
  * none of tables your tried messed up the order of the rows or columns.

It takes more time -- the data processing was not transparent.



**6 months later, you want to explore:** $X_{2} \to Y_{2}$.

* You found out Excel had some bugs in it's statistical calculations (see e.g., https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/TheresaScott/StatsInExcel.TAScot.handout.pdf).




**2 years later, you want to replicate:** $\{ X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3} \} \to Y_{1}$


* A rival has proposed an alternative theory. Their idea doesn't actually make any sense, but their visuals are better and statistics are more sophisticated.
* You don't even have that computer anymore.
* A collaborator who handled the data on $X_{2}$ has moved on.



## An alternative workflow

Suppose you decided to code what you did beginning with Step 2.

**It doesn't take much time to update or replicate your results.**

* Your computer runs for 2 hours and reproduces the figures and tables.
(You wrote your big calculations to use multiple cores and this saved 6 hours--each time.)
* You decided to add some more data, and it adds almost no time.
* You see the exact steps you took and found an error
(glad you found it before publication!)


**Your results are transparent and easier to build on.**

* You easily see that not much has changed with the new data.
* You try out a new plot you found in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, by Edward Tufte.
  * It's not a standard plot, but google answers most of your questions.
  * Tutorials help avoid bad practices, such as plotting 2D data as a 3D object (see e.g., https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html).
* You try out an obscure statistical approach that's hot in your field.
  * it doesn't make the paper, but you have some confidence that candidate issue isn't a big problem


# Small Scale Projects
***


## Types of Projects

Homework reports are the smallest and probably first document you create. We will create little homework reports using R markdown that are almost entirely self-contained (showing both code and output). To do this, you will need to install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) on your computer.

Posters and presentations are another important type of scientific document. R markdown is good at creating both of these, and actually *very* good with some additional packages. So we will also use [flexdashboard](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) for posters and [beamer]( https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/beamer-presentation.html) for presentions. Since beamer is a pdf output, you will need to install [TinyTex](https://yihui.org/tinytex/), which can be done within R

```r
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()  # install TinyTeX
```

Install any required packages

```r
## Packages for Rmarkdown
install.packages("knitr")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("bookdown")

## Other packages used in this primer
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("sf")
```


Note that

* R is our software
* Rstudio is our GUI
* R-markdown is our document

R and R markdown are also both languages: R studio interprets R code to produce statistics, R studio interprets R markdown code to produce pretty documents which contain both writing and statistics. You should already be a bit familiar with R, but not necessarily R Markdown. So to get you started, you should first read and work through this document, and then recreate it yourself as a litte tutorial. Before hopping into programming, however, understand why you will learn to program in both R and R-markdown languages


## Why R and R-Markdown

Good for complex stats, concise figures, and coherent organization.

* Built and developed by applied statisticians for statistics.
* Used by many in academia and industry.


Good for reproducible research 

* http://www.r-bloggers.com/the-reproducibility-crisis-in-science-and-prospects-for-r/
* http://fmwww.bc.edu/GStat/docs/pointclick.html
* https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R\#reproducible-research
* A Guide to Reproducible Code in Ecology and Evolution
* https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/TheresaScott/ReproducibleResearch.TAScott.handout.pdf


Good for teaching

* https://doi.org/10.1080/00220485.2019.1618765
* https://doi.org/10.1002/jae.657


Good for getting a job

* As a student, think about labour demand. R skills, unlike other purely academic software, is something future employers use and want. Do more of your own research on this to understand how much to invest.




## HW Example {.tabset}
Below is a template of what questions (and answers) look like. 

### Question1
Simulate 100 random observations of the form $y=x\beta+\epsilon$ and plot the relationship. Plot and explore the data interactively via plotly, https://plotly.com/r/line-and-scatter/. Then play around with different styles, https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/13-scatter-plot.html, to best express your point.

*Answer*
I simulate $400$ observations for $\epsilon \sim 2\times N(0,1)$ and $\beta=4$, as seen in this single chunk. Notice an upward trend.

```r
n <- 100
E <- rnorm(n)
X <- seq(n)
Y <- 4*X + 2*E

library(plotly)
plot_ly( data=data.frame(X=X,Y=Y), x=~X, y=~Y)
```

*Answer*

### Question 2
Verify the definition of a line segment for points $A=(0,3), B=(1,5)$ using a $101 \times 101$ grid. Recall a line segment is all points $s$ that have $d(s, A) + d(s, B) = d(A, B)$.

*Answer* 

```r
library(sf)
s_1 <- c(0,3)
s_2 <- c(1,5)
Seg1 <- st_linestring( rbind(s_1,s_2) )
grid_pts <- expand.grid(
    x=seq(s_1[1],s_2[1], length.out=101),
    y=seq(s_1[2],s_2[2], length.out=101)
)

Seg1_dist <- dist( Seg1 )
grid_pts$dist <- apply(grid_pts, 1, function(s){
    dist( rbind(s,s_1) ) + dist( rbind(s,s_2) ) })
grid_pts$seg <- grid_pts$dist == Seg1_dist

D_point_seg <- st_multipoint( as.matrix(grid_pts[grid_pts$seg==T,1:2]) ) 
D_point_notseg <- st_multipoint( as.matrix(grid_pts[grid_pts$seg==F,1:2]) ) 

plot(Seg1)
points(D_point_notseg, col=2, pch='.')
points(D_point_seg)
box()
```

# Medium Scale Projects
***

As you scale up to a medium sized project, however, you will have to be more organized.


Medium sized projects should have their own `Project` folder on your computer with files, subdirectories with files, and subsubdirectories with files. It should look like this
```
Project
    └── README.txt
    └── /Code
        └── MAKEFILE.R
        └── RBLOCK_001_DataClean.R
        └── RBLOCK_002_Figures.R
        └── RBLOCK_003_ModelsTests.R
        └── RBLOCK_004_Robust.R
        └── /Logs
            └── MAKEFILE.Rout
    └── /Data
        └── /Raw
            └── Source1.csv
            └── Source2.shp
            └── Source3.txt
        └── /Clean
            └── AllDatasets.Rdata
            └── MainDataset1.Rds
            └── MainDataset2.csv
    └── /Output
        └── MainFigure.pdf
        └── AppendixFigure.pdf
        └── MainTable.tex
        └── AppendixTable.tex
    └── /Writing
        └── /TermPaper
            └── TermPaper.tex
            └── TermPaper.bib
            └── TermPaper.pdf
        └── /Slides
            └── Slides.Rmd
            └── Slides.html
            └── Slides.pdf
        └── /Poster
            └── Poster.Rmd
            └── Poster.html
            └── Poster.pdf
        └── /Proposal
            └── Proposal.Rmd
            └── Proposal.html
            └── Proposal.pdf
```



## MAKEFILE

There are two main meta-files

* `README.txt` overviews the project structure and what the codes are doing
* `MAKEFILE` explicitly describes and executes all codes. 



If all code is written with the same program, the makefile can be written in that programs code: `MAKEFILE.R`, which looks like

```r
### Project Structure
home_dir    <- path.expand("~/Desktop/Project/")

data_dir    <- paste0(home_dir, "Data/")
data_dir_r  <- paste0(data_dir, "Raw/")
data_dir_c  <- paste0(data_dir, "Clean/")

out_dir  <- paste0(hdir, "Output/")

code_dir  <- paste0(hdir, "Code/")


### Execute Codes
set.wd( code_dir )
source( "RBLOCK_001_DataClean.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_002_Figures.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_003_ModelsTests.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_004_Robust.R" )
```


If some folders or files are not created, you can do this within R

```r
# create directory called 'Data'
dir.create('Data')

# list the files and directories
list.files(recursive=TRUE, include.dirs=TRUE)
```


## Logging/Sinking

You can then execute the makefile within R and log the output. Either by 

1. Inserting some code that logs/sinks the output 

```r
### Project Structure
home_dir    <- path.expand("~/Desktop/Project/")

data_dir    <- paste0(home_dir, "Data/")
data_dir_r  <- paste0(data_dir, "Raw/")
data_dir_c  <- paste0(data_dir, "Clean/")

out_dir  <- paste0(hdir, "Output/")

code_dir  <- paste0(hdir, "Code/")

### Log Output
set.wd( code_dir )
sink("MAKEFILE.Rout", append=TRUE, split=TRUE)

### Execute Codes
source( "RBLOCK_001_DataClean.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_002_Figures.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_003_ModelsTests.R" )
source( "RBLOCK_004_Robust.R" )

### Stop Logging Output
sink()
```

2. Starting a session that logs/sinks you sourcing the makefile

```r
sink("MAKEFILE.Rout", append=TRUE, split=TRUE)
source("MAKEFILE.R")
sink()
```

3. Execute the makefile via the commandline 

```bash
R CMD BATCH MAKEFILE.R MAKEFILE.Rout
```


## Final Step

Zip your project into a single file that is easy for *others* to identify: `Class_Project_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME.zip`

Your code should be readable and error free. For code writing guides, see

* https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html
* https://style.tidyverse.org/
* https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~jerrick/courses/stat701/notes/codestyle.html
* http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html
* https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf



For additional logging capabilities, see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/logr/

For very large projects, there are many more tools available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html





# Replication
***

## An R Code Chunk

Save the following code as `CodeChunk.R`

```r
sum_squared <- function(x1, x2) {
	y <- (x1 + x2)^2
	return(y)
} 

x <- c(0,1,3,10,6)
sum_squared(x[1], x[3])
sum_squared(x, x[2])
sum_squared(x, x[7])
sum_squared(x, x) 
```

**Clean the workspace** In the right panels, manually cleanup

* save the code as *RandRstudio.Rmd*
* clear the environment and history (use the broom in top right panel)
* clear unsaved plots (use the broom in bottom right panel)
    
    
**Replicate** using the grahical user interface (GUI) while in Rstudio either using a "point-click" or "console" method

*GUI: point-click*
click 'Source > Source as a local job' on top right

*GUI: console*
into the console on the bottom left, enter

```r
source('CodeChunk.R')
```



(Skippable) There are also alternative ways to replicate via the command line interface (CLI) after opening a terminal
 
*CLI: console*

```bash
Rscript -e "source('CodeChunk.R')"
```

*CLI: direct*


```bash
Rscript CodeChunk.R
```

You can open a new terminal in RStudio in the top bar by
clicking 'tools > terminal > new terminal'





## An R Markdown Document


**Download code** from the top right button in the R Primers


**Clean**
Also delete any files and sections which you do not want (*summarytable_example.txt* and *plot_example.pdf* and section *Data analysis examples: custom figures*)
    

**Replicate** 

You can now create the primers by opening the Rstudio GUI and then point-and-click. Alternatively,

*GUI: console*

```r
rmarkdown::render('RandRstudio.Rmd')
rmarkdown::render('RReproducible.Rmd')
```

# Other Software {.tabset}

## Stata

For those transitioning from Stata or replicating others' Stata work, you can work with Stata data and code within R.

Translations of common procedures is provided by https://stata2r.github.io/

The `foreign` package allows you to read data created by different programs, including Stata.

```r
library(foreign) 
read.dta
```

You can also execute stata commands directly in R via package `Rstata`. (Last time I checked, `Rstata` requires you to have purchased a non-student version of Stata.) Moreover, you can include stata in the markdown reports via package `Statamarkdown`:

```r
library(Rstata)
library(Statamarkdown)
```

There are many R packages to replicate or otherwise directly copy what Stata does. For example, see the `margins` package  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/margins/vignettes/Introduction.html



For more information on R and Stata, see

* https://github.com/lbraglia/RStata
* https://ignacioriveros1.github.io/r/2020/03/22/r_and_stata.html
* https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/eng-stata.html

* https://clanfear.github.io/Stata_R_Equivalency/docs/r_stata_commands.html
* https://libguides.bates.edu/c.php?g=209169&p=7233333

You can also use other software (such as Python) within R. You can also use R within Stata, or both within Python. With R, you can easily import many different data types

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-data.html
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/data-import.pdf

## General Workflow

If you want to go further down the reproducibility route (recommended, but not required for our class), consider making your entire workflow use Free Open Source Software


**Linux:** An alternative to windows and mac operating systems.
Used in computing clusters, big labs, and phones.
E.g., Ubuntu and Fedora are popular brands

On Fedora, you can open RStudio on the commandline with

```bash
rstudio
```

Alternatively, you are encouraged to try using R without a GUI. E.g., on Fedora, this document can be created directly via 

```bash
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('RMarkown.Rmd')"
```



**Latex:** An alternative to microsoft word.
Great for writing many equations and typsetting.
Easy to integrate Figures, Tables, and References.
Steep learning curve.

* easiest to get started online with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
* can also download yourself via [Tex Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)

## R Workflow




**Sweave:** is an alternative to Rmarkdown for integrating latex and R. While Rmarkdown "writes R and latex within markdown", Sweave "write R in latex". Sweave files end in ".Rnw" and can be called within R


```r
Sweave('Sweave_file.Rnw')
```

or directly from the command line


```bash
R CMD Sweave Sweave_file.Rnw 
```

In both cases, a latex file `Sweave_file.tex` is produced, which can then be converted to `Sweave_file.pdf`.

**Knitr:** 
You can also produce a pdf from an .Rnw file via `knitr`


```bash
Rscript -e "knitr::Sweave2knitr('Sweave_file.Rnw')"
Rscript -e "knitr::knit2pdf('Sweave_file-knitr.Rnw')"
```
