This [Rbook](https://jadamso.github.io/Rbooks/) contains three primers that should get you going with R in econometrics research

 * *Part   I*: Programming in R
 * *Part  II*: Linear Regression in R
 * *Part III*: Reproducible Research in R

Much of the programming material (Parts I and III) was copied or modified from elsewhere. I include references when I remembered to.

Much of Part II was also copied from elsewhere, namely other econometrics textbooks. I cut a lot of material pertaining to inference with linear models and treat it more as a technical prerequisite for more advanced econometrics (thus taking seriously Greene's "Model Building--A General to Simple Strategy"). I also include a novel chapter on `Data scientism' that illustrates some of the limits and ways linear models mislead rather than illuminate. This provides a more humble view towards what we can say with linear models and leaves more room for economic theory in model development and interpretation.

These notes are actively developed for my classes, although any interested reader may find it useful. Please report any errors/issues at https://github.com/Jadamso/Rbooks/issues.
