This [Rbook](https://jadamso.github.io/Rbooks/) introduces students to econometrics without parametric assumptions and formulas. In many ways, it is a modern version of "Introductory Econometrics: Using Monte Carlo Simulation with Microsoft Excel" by Barreto and Howland, updated to give econometrics students the best tools for their labor market and adhere to modern statistics [teaching guidelines](https://www.amstat.org/education/curriculum-guidelines-for-undergraduate-programs-in-statistical-science-). Along these lines, many practical programming examples are also included, including on how to analyze data interactively and communicate results. This book also serves as a technical prerequisite for more advanced courses (such as nonparametric statistics or structural econometrics.)

The Rbook is organized into three parts

 * *Part   I*: Programming in R
 * *Part  II*: Linear Regression in R
 * *Part III*: Reproducible Research in R

Parts I and III synthesize a lot of programming guidance and examples now available on the internet. Part II refines material from several introductory econometrics textbooks and covers linear models only from a "minimum distance" perspective. (We operate under the maxim "All models are wrong" and do not prove unbiasedness.) Also included is a novel chapter on "Data scientism" that more clearly illustrates the ways that simplistic approaches can mislead rather than illuminate. (I stress "gun safety" instead of "pull to shoot", which I feel is missing from many textbooks.) Overall, there is a more humble view towards what we can infer from linear regressions and more room for economic theory in model development and interpretation.
