This [Rbook](https://jadamso.github.io/Rbooks/) contains three primers that should get you started with econometrics in R

 * *Part   I*: Programming in R
 * *Part  II*: Linear Regression in R
 * *Part III*: Reproducible Research in R

In many ways, this Rbook is a more modern version of "Introductory Econometrics: Using Monte Carlo Simulation with Microsoft Excel" by Barreto and Howland. I am  actively developping it for my students, although any interested reader may find it useful. Please report any errors/issues at https://github.com/Jadamso/Rbooks/issues.

Much of Parts I and III were copied from elsewhere and modified over the years. I include references when I could, even if at the end of a chapter. Much of Part II was also originally copied from elsewhere, namely other econometrics textbooks. I  borrowed and learned from the following texbooks, which I still recommend

 * "Introduction to Econometrics" by Stock and Watson. Parts 1,2, and 3.
 * "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Wooldridge. Part 1.
 * "Applied Econometrics" by Asterlou. Parts I,II, and III.

I differ by focusing more on simulations, which makes it easy to absorb the basic statistical ideas without parametric assumptions and formulas. I also differ by deemphasizing inference with linear models and treat it more as a technical prerequisite for more advanced econometrics. (In particular, I include a novel chapter on 'Data scientism' that more clearly illustrates the ways that linear models can mislead rather than illuminate. And this provides a more humble view towards what we can infer from statistics alone and leaves more room for economic theory in model development and interpretation.)
