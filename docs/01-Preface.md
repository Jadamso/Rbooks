This [Rbook](https://jadamso.github.io/Rbooks/) contains three primers that should get you started with econometrics in R

 * *Part   I*: Programming in R
 * *Part  II*: Linear Regression in R
 * *Part III*: Reproducible Research in R

Compared to other introductory econometrics books, this Rbook focuses more on simulations. So, in many ways, it is a more modern version of "Introductory Econometrics: Using Monte Carlo Simulation with Microsoft Excel" by Barreto and Howland. This makes it easy to absorb basic statistical ideas without parametric assumptions and formulas. This Rbook also deemphasizes inference with linear models, treating it more as a technical prerequisite for more advanced econometrics courses. There is a novel chapter on 'Data scientism' that more clearly illustrates the ways that linear models can mislead rather than illuminate. Overall, their is a humble view towards what we can infer from statistics alone and more room for economic theory in model development and interpretation.

Much material was originally copied from elsewhere and then modified over the years on an ad-hoc basis. Parts I and III synthesize a lot of programming guidance and examples available on the internet, and I include online references when I could (typically at the end of a chapter).  Much of Part II originally comes from econometrics textbooks, especially the following texbooks which I learned from and still recommend

 * "Introduction to Econometrics" by Stock and Watson. Parts 1,2, and 3.
 * "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach" by Wooldridge. Part 1.
 * "Applied Econometrics" by Asterlou. Parts I,II, and III.


Although any interested reader may find it useful, it is being primarily developped for my students. Please report any errors/issues at https://github.com/Jadamso/Rbooks/issues.
