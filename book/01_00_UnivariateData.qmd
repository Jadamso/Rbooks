# Univariate Data

This part introduces one-variable (univariate) data analysis using a data-first computational approach. You will learn how to summarize distributions, reason about sampling variability, and construct confidence intervals and hypothesis tests with both resampling and normal approximations. The focus is practical statistical reasoning and implementation in R.
