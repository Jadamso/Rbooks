# Bivariate Data

This part extends the same data-first approach to relationships between two variables. It covers bivariate distributions, group comparisons, association statistics, linear and local regression, and prediction-focused inference. The emphasis is how to choose, evaluate, and communicate bivariate models using real data in R.
