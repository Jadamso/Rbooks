There are two main ways to conduct a hypothesis test to do so: inverting a confidence interval and imposing the null. The first treats the distribution of estimates directly; the second explicitly enforces the null hypothesis to evaluate how unusual the observed statistic is. Both approaches rely on the bootstrap: resampling the data to approximate sampling variability. The most typical case is hypothesizing about about the mean, and the bootstrap idea here is to approximate $M-\\mu$, the difference between the sample mean $M$ and the unknown theoretical mean $\\mu$, with the difference between the bootstrap mean $M^{\\text{boot}}$ and the sample mean, $M^{\\text{boot}}-M$.\n\n#### **Invert a CI**.{-}\n\nOne main way to conduct hypothesis tests is to examine whether a confidence interval contains a hypothesized value. We then use this decision rule\n\n* reject the null if value falls outside of the interval\n* fail to reject the null if value falls inside of the interval\n\nWe typically use a $95\\%$ confidence interval to create a *rejection region*. \n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\nFor example, suppose you hypothesize the mean is $9$. You then construct a bootstrap distribution with $95\\%$ confidence interval, and find your hypothesized value falls outside of the confidence interval. Then, after accounting for sampling variability (which you estimate), it still seems extremely unlikely that the theoretical mean actually equals $9$, so you reject that that hypothesis. (If the theoretical value landed in the interval, you would \"fail to reject\" the theoretical mean equals $9$.)\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample_dat <- USArrests[,'Murder']\nsample_mean <- mean(sample_dat)\n\nset.seed(1) # to be replicable\nbootstrap_means <- vector(length=999)\nfor(b in seq_along(bootstrap_means)){\n    dat_b <- sample(sample_dat, replace=T) \n    mean_b <- mean(dat_b)\n    bootstrap_means[b] <- mean_b\n}\nhist(bootstrap_means, breaks=25,\n    border=NA,\n    main='',\n    xlab='Bootstrap Samples')\n# CI\nci_95 <- quantile(bootstrap_means, probs=c(.025, .975))\nabline(v=ci_95, lwd=2)\n# H0: mean=9\nabline(v=9, col=2, lwd=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_07_HypothesisTests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n#### **Impose the Null**. {-}\nWe can also compute a *null distribution*: the sampling distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis (assuming your null hypothesis was true). We use the bootstrap to loop through a large number of \"resamples\". In each iteration of the loop, we impose the null hypothesis and re-estimate the statistic of interest. We then calculate the range of the statistic across all resamples and compare how extreme the original value we observed is.\n\n:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\nFor example, suppose you hypothesize the mean is $9$. You then construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval around the *null* bootstrap distribution (resamples centered around $9$). If your sample mean falls outside of that interval, then even after accounting for sampling variability (which you estimate), it seems extremely unlikely that the theoretical mean actually equals $9$, so you reject that that hypothesis. (If the sample mean landed in the interval, you would \"fail to reject\" the theoretical mean equals $9$.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsample_dat <- USArrests[,'Murder']\nsample_mean <- mean(sample_dat)\n\n# Bootstrap NULL: mean=9\n# Bootstrap shift: center each bootstrap resample so that the distribution satisfies the null hypothesis on average.\nset.seed(1)\nmu <- 9\nbootstrap_means_null <- vector(length=999)\nfor(b in seq_along(bootstrap_means_null)){\n    dat_b <- sample(sample_dat, replace=T) \n    mean_b <- mean(dat_b) + (mu - sample_mean) # impose the null via Bootstrap shift\n    bootstrap_means_null[b] <- mean_b\n}\nhist(bootstrap_means_null, breaks=25, border=NA,\n    main='',\n    xlab='Null Bootstrap Samples')\nci_95 <- quantile(bootstrap_means_null, probs=c(.025, .975)) # critical region\nabline(v=ci_95, lwd=2)\nabline(v=sample_mean, lwd=2, col=4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_07_HypothesisTests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n \n## $p$-values\n\nA $p$-value is the frequency you see something as extreme as your statistic when sampling from the null distribution.

That is false.\n\nOften, one may also see or hear \"$p<.05$: statistically significant\" and \"$p>.05$: not statistically significant\". That is decision making on purely statistical grounds, and it may or may not be suitable for your context.

In this class, we skip this because we can simply bootstrap the $t$ statistic too.]\n\n#### **Quantiles and Shape Statistics**. {-}\n\nBootstrap allows hypothesis tests for any statistic, not just the mean, without relying on parametric theory. For example, the above procedures generalize from means to quantile statistics like medians.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Test for Median Differences (Impose the Null)\n# Bootstrap Null Distribution for the median\n# Each Bootstrap shifts medians so that median = q_null\n\nq_obs <- quantile(sample_dat, probs=.5)\nq_null <- 7.8\nbootstrap_quantile_null <- vector(length=999)\nfor(b in seq_along(bootstrap_quantile_null)){\n    x_b <- sample(sample_dat, replace=T) #bootstrap sample\n    q_b <- quantile(x_b, probs=.5) # median\n    d_b <- q_b - (q_obs-q_null) #impose the null\n    bootstrap_quantile_null[b] <- d_b \n}\n\n    # Note that you could also standardize like the t value.

Perhaps the most informative are differences in spread or shape. E.g., you can conduct hypothesis tests for `sd` and `IQR`, or `skew` and `kurtosis`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Test for SD Differences (Invert CI)\nsd_obs <- sd(sample_dat)\nsd_null <- 3.6\nbootstrap_sd <- vector(length=999)\nfor(b in seq_along(bootstrap_sd)){\n    x_b <- sample(sample_dat, replace=T)\n    sd_b <- sd(x_b)\n    bootstrap_sd[b] <- sd_b\n}\n\nhist(bootstrap_sd, freq=F,\n    border=NA, xlab='Bootstrap', font.main=1,\n    main='Standard Deviations (Invert CI)')\nsd_ci <- quantile(bootstrap_sd, probs=c(0.25,.975) )\nabline(v=sd_ci, lwd=2)\nabline(v=sd_null, lwd=2, col=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_07_HypothesisTests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n\n\n# Try any function!\n# IQR(x_b)/median(x_b)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## One-Sided Tests\n\nAbove, we tested whether the observed statistic is either extremely high or low. This is known as a two-sided test. There are also two one-sided tests (left tail: observed statistic is extremely low, right tail: observed statistic is extremely high). For a concrete example, consider whether the mean statistic, $M$, is centered on a theoretical value of $\\mu=9$ for the population. If your null hypothesis is that the theoretical mean is nine, $H_{0}: \\mu =9$, and you calculated the mean for your sample as $\\hat{M}$, then you can consider any one of these three alternative hypotheses:\n\n* $H_{A}​: \\mu \\neq 9$, a two-tail test\n* $H_{A}: \\mu < 9$, a left-tail test\n* $H_{A​}: \\mu > 9$, a right-tail test\n\nA one-sided test is associated with an interval that shifted to one side, containing one tail rather than the middle. For example, a left tail test that \"inverts a CI\" uses the interval $(-\\infty, q_{0.95}]$, where $q_{0.95}$ is the $95^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the bootstrap distribution. If the hypothesized value falls inside that interval, then we fail to reject the null (at the $5\\%$ level), otherwise we reject the null (it seems extremely unlikely that we would find such a large value). A left tail test that \"inverts a CI\" uses the interval $[q_{0.05}, \\infty)$, where $q_{0.05}$ is the $5^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the bootstrap distribution.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\nHere is right-tail Test example\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# ALTERNATIVE: mean > 9\n# Visualize One Sided Prob. & reject region boundary\nhist(bootstrap_means, border=NA, breaks=50,\n    freq=F, main=NA, xlab='Null Bootstrap')\nabline(v=sample_mean, col=4)\nci_95 <- quantile(bootstrap_means, probs=c(0.05,1) )\nabline(v=ci_95, lwd=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](01_07_HypothesisTests_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\nFor me at least, “invert a CI” is the most intuitive way to conduct hypothesis test using intervals. \nHowever, there are \"Impose the Null\" intervals, which are reversed, that correspond more closely to $p$-values.\n\n#### **One-Sided Intervals that \"Impose the Null\"**. {-}\n\n<details>\n<summary> Advanced and Optional </summary>\n  <p>\nA right tail test that \"imposes the null\" uses the interval $(-\\infty, q_{0.95}]$, where $q_{0.95}$ is the $95^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the null bootstrap distribution: If the observed value falls inside that interval, then we fail to reject the null (at the $5\\%$ level), otherwise we reject the null (it seems extremely unlikely that we would find such a small value). A left tail test that \"imposes the null\" uses the interval $[q_{0.05}, \\infty)$, where $q_{0.05}$ is the $5^{\\text{th}}$ percentile of the null bootstrap distribution. Referring to the hypothetical value generally as $\\mu_0$ instead of the particular number $9$, we can summarize the one-sided decision rules as\n\n| | Tail | Reject when | Fail to reject when |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Impose the Null**<br>(shifted/bootstrap-null) | *Right-tail*<br> $H_A: \\mu > \\mu_0$ | $\\hat{M} > q^{\\text{null}}_{0.95}$ | $\\hat{M} \\le q^{\\text{null}}_{0.95}$ |\n|                                                                  | *Left-tail*<br>$H_A: \\mu < \\mu_0$   | $\\hat{M} < q^{\\text{null}}_{0.05}$ | $\\hat{M} \\ge q^{\\text{null}}_{0.05}$ |\n| **Invert a CI**<br>(percentile CI)               | *Right-tail*<br>$H_A: \\mu > \\mu_0$  | $\\mu_0 < q^{\\text{boot}}_{0.05}$   | $\\mu_0 \\ge q^{\\text{boot}}_{0.05}$   |\n|                                                                  | *Left-tail*<br> $H_A: \\mu < \\mu_0$  | $\\mu_0 > q^{\\text{boot}}_{0.95}$   | $\\mu_0 \\le q^{\\text{boot}}_{0.95}$  |\n  </p>\n</details>\n\n\n#### **One-Sided $p$-values**. {-}\n\nThe $p$-value for a one-sided test is more straightforward to implement via a bootstrap null distribution. \n\nFor a left-tail test, we examine \\begin{eqnarray}\np = Prob( M < \\hat{M} \\mid \\mu = 9 )\n    &\\approx& Prob( M^{\\text{boot}} < \\hat{M} \\mid  \\mu^{\\text{boot}} = 9 ) = \\hat{F}^{\\text{boot}}_{0}(\\hat{M}),\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\hat{F}^{\\text{boot}}_{0}$ is the ECDF of the bootstrap null distribution.
