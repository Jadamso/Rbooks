You also want your work to be replicable\n\n* *Replicable*: someone collecting new data comes to the same results.\n* *Reproducibile*: someone reusing your data comes to the same results.\n\nYou can read more about the distinction in many places, including\n\n* <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-020821-114157>\n* <https://nceas.github.io/sasap-training/materials/reproducible_research_in_r_fairbanks/>\n\nWe focus on R because it is good for complex stats, concise figures, and coherent organization. It is built and developed by applied statisticians for statistics, and used by many in academia and industry. For students, think about labor demand and what may be good for getting a job. Do some of your own research to best understand how much to invest.\n\n\nMy main sell to you is that being reproducible is in your own self-interest.\n\n#### **An example workflow**. {-}\n\n***First Steps...***\n\n*Step 1*:  Some ideas and data about how variable $X_{1}$ affects variable $Y_{1}$, which we denote as $X_{1}\\to Y_{1}$\n\n* You copy some data into a spreadsheet, manually aggregate\n* do some calculations and tables the same spreadsheet\n* some other analysis from here and there, using this software and that.\n\n*Step 2*:  Pursuing the lead for a week or two\n\n* you extend your dataset with more observations\n* copy in a spreadsheet data, manually aggregate\n* do some more calculations and tables, same as before\n\n***A Little Way Down the Road ...***\n\n1 month later: someone asks about another factor: $X_{2}$\n\n* you download some other type of data\n* You repeat <u>Step 2</u> with some data on $X_{2}$.\n* The details from your \"point and click\" method are a bit fuzzy.\n* It takes a little time, but you successfully redo the analysis.\n\n4 months later: someone asks about another factor $X_{3}\\to Y_{1}$\n\n* You again repeat <u>Step 2</u> with some data on $X_{3}$.\n* You're pretty sure none of tables your tried messed up the order of the rows or columns.\n* It takes more time and effort. The data processing was not transparent, but you eventually redo the analysis.\n\n6 months later: you want to explore another outcome $X_{2} \\to Y_{2}$.\n\n* You found out Excel had some bugs in it's statistical calculations (see e.g., <https://biostat.app.vumc.org/wiki/pub/Main/TheresaScott/StatsInExcel.TAScot.handout.pdf>). You now use a new version of the spreadsheet\n* You're not sure you merged everything correctly. After much time and effort, most (but not all) of the numbers match exactly.\n\n2 years later: your boss wants you to replicate $\\{ X_{1}, X_{2}, X_{3} \\} \\to Y_{1}$\n\n* A rival has proposed something new. Their idea doesn't actually make any sense, but their figures and statistics look better.\n* You don't even use that computer anymore and a collaborator who handled the data on $X_{2}$ has moved on.\n\n\n#### **An alternative workflow**. {-}\n\nSuppose you decided to code what you did beginning with Step 2.\n\nIt does not take much time to update or replicate your results.\n\n* Your computer runs for 2 hours and reproduces the figures and tables.\n* You also rewrote your big calculations to use multiple cores, this took two hours to do but saved 6 hours *each time* you rerun your code.\n* You add some more data. It adds almost no time to see whether much has changed.\n\nYour results are transparent and easier to build on.\n\n* You see the exact steps you took and found an error\n  * Google *\"worst Excel errors\"* and note the frequency they arise from copy/paste via the \"point-and-click\" approach. E.g., *Fidelity's $2.6 Billion Dividend Error*.\n    * Glad you found a problem before sending your research out! See <https://retractionwatch.com/> and <https://econjwatch.org/>. Future economists should also read <https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/300464894.pdf>.\n* You try out a new plot you found in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*, by Edward Tufte.\n  * It's not a standard plot, but google answers most of your questions.\n  * Tutorials help avoid bad practices, such as plotting 2D data as a 3D object (see e.g., <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/no-3d.html>).\n* You try out an obscure statistical approach that's hot in your field.\n  * it doesn't make the report, but you have some confidence that candidate issue isn't a big problem\n\n\n## First Steps\n\n#### **Install R**. {-}\n\nFirst Install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/).\nThen Install [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).\n\nFor help setting up, see any of the following links\n\n* <https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/>\n* <https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html>\n* <https://a-little-book-of-r-for-bioinformatics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installr.html>\n* <https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html>\n* <https://courses.edx.org/courses/UTAustinX/UT.7.01x/3T2014/56c5437b88fa43cf828bff5371c6a924/>\n* <https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/installr/>\n* <https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/setup-r-rstudio/>\n\nFor Fedora users, note that you need to first enable the repo and then install\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsudo dnf install 'dnf-command(copr)'\nsudo dnf copr enable iucar/rstudio\nsudo dnf install rstudio-desktop\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n*Make sure you have the latest version of R and Rstudio for class.* If not, then reinstall. \n\n#### **Interfacing with R**. {-}\n\nRstudio is perhaps the easiest to get going with. (There are other GUI's.)\n\nIn Rstudio, there are 4 panes. (If you do not see 4, click \"file > new file > R script\" on the top left of the toolbar.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./Figures_Manual/Rstudio.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe top left pane is where you write your code. For example, type\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1+1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe pane below is where your code is executed. \nKeep you mouse on the same line as your code, and then click \"Run\". \nYou should see\n```\n> 1+1\n[1] 2\n```\nIf you click \"Run\" again, you should see that same output printed again.\n\n\nAs we proceed, you can see both my source code and output like this:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1+1\n## [1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n***Multiple Lines***.\n\nYou should add comments to your codes, and you do this with hashtags. For example\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## This is my first comment!\n1+1 # The simplest calculation I could think of\n## [1] 2\n```\n:::\n\nYou can execute each line one-at-a-time. \n\nOr you can highlight them both, to take advantage of how R executes commands line by line.\n\n\n***Assignment***.\n\nYou can create \"variables\" that store values. For example,\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 1 # Make your first variable\nx + 1 # The simplest calculation I could think of\n## [1] 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- 23 #Another example\nx + 1\n## [1] 24\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- x + 1 #Another example\ny\n## [1] 24\n```\n:::\n\n\nYour variables must be defined in order to use them. Otherwise you get an error. For example,\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nX +   1 # notice that R is sensitive to capitalization but not spacing\n## Error: object 'X' not found\n```\n:::\n\n\nYour variable names do not matter technically, but they should be informative\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none <- 1 # good variable name\none\n## [1] 1\n\none <- 43 # bad variable name\none\n## [1] 43\n```\n:::\n\n\nGood names avoid confusion later\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_plus_2 <- one + 2  #bad names propogate\n\nx <- 43\nx_plus_two <- x + 2 # better\n```\n:::\n\n\n***Scripting***.\n\n* Create a folder on your computer to save your scripts\n* Save your `R Script` file as *My_First_Script.R* in your folder\n* Close Rstudio\n* Open your script and re-run it\n\nAs you work through the material, make sure to both execute and save your scripts. Add lots of commentary to your scripts. Name your scripts systematically.\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\nThere are many good and free programming materials online.\n\nThe most common tasks can be found <https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf>\n\nSome of my programming examples originally come from <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/> and I recommend <https://intro2r.com>. \n\nI have also used online material from many places over the years, as there are many good yet free-online tutorials and courses specifically on R programming.
