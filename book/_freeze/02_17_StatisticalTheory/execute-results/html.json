Note, however, that we have to compute the standard error for the difference statistic, which is a bit more complicated. Under the assumption that both populations are independent distributed, we can analytically derive the sampling distribution for the differences between two groups. \n\nIn particular, the $t$-statistic is used to compare two groups.\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\hat{t} = \\frac{\n    \\hat{M}_{Y1} - \\hat{M}_{Y2}\n}{\n    \\sqrt{\\hat{S}_{Y1}+\\hat{S}_{Y2}}/\\sqrt{n}\n},\n\\end{eqnarray}\nWith normally distributed means, this statistic follows Student's [t-distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution).\nWelch's [$t$-statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welch%27s_t-test) is an adjustment for two normally distributed populations with potentially unequal variances or sample sizes. With the above assumptions, one can conduct hypothesis tests entirely using math.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Sample 1 (e.g., males)\nn1 <- 100\nY1 <- rnorm(n1, 0, 2)\n#hist(Y1, freq=F, main='Sample 1')\n\n# Sample 2 (e.g., females)\nn2 <- 80\nY2 <- rnorm(n2, 1, 1)\n#hist(Y2, freq=F, main='Sample 2')\n\nt.test(Y1, Y2, var.equal=F)\n## \n## \tWelch Two Sample t-test\n## \n## data:  Y1 and Y2\n## t = -3.6628, df = 152.63, p-value = 0.0003435\n## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n## 95 percent confidence interval:\n##  -1.2692626 -0.3797979\n## sample estimates:\n## mean of x mean of y \n## 0.2941225 1.1186527\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIf we want to test for the differences in medians across groups with independent observations, we can also use notches in the boxplot. If the notches of two boxes do not overlap, then there is rough evidence that the difference in medians is statistically significant. The square root of the sample size is also shown as the bin width in each boxplot.^[Let each group $g$ have median $\\tilde{M}_{g}$, interquartile range $\\hat{IQR}_{g}$, observations $n_{g}$. We can compute standard deviation of the median as $\\tilde{S}_{g}= \\frac{1.25 \\hat{IQR}_{g}}{1.35 \\sqrt{n_{g}}}$. As a rough guess, the interval $\\tilde{M}_{g} \\pm 1.7 \\tilde{S}_{g}$ is the historical default and displayed as a *notch* in the boxplot.

Because we base conclusions on sample data, which has variability, mistakes are possible. There are two types of errors:\n\n* *Type I Error*: Rejecting a true null hypothesis. (False Positive). \n* *Type II Error*: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis (False Negative). \n\n| True Situation | Decision: Fail to Reject $H_0$ | Decision: Reject $H_0$ |\n|---|---|---|\n| $H_0$ is True  |  Correct (no detection)  |  Type I Error (False Positive) |\n| $H_0$ is False |  Type II Error (False Negative; missed detection) | Correct (effect detected) |\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\nHere is a Courtroom example: Someone suspected of committing a crime is at trial, and they are either guilty or not (a Bernoulli random variable). You hypothesize that the suspect is innocent, and a jury can either convict them (decide guilty) or free them (decide not-guilty). Recall that fail-to-reject a hypothesis does mean accepting it, so deciding not-guilty does not necessarily mean innocent.\n\n| True Situation | Decision: Free | Decision: Convict |\n|---|---|---|\n| Suspect Innocent |  Correctly Freed  | Falsely Convicted |\n| Suspect Guilty   |  Falsely Freed    | Correctly Convicted |\n:::\n\n#### **Statistical Power**. {-}\n\nThe probability of Type I Error is called *significance level* and denoted by $Prob(\\text{Type I Error}) = \\alpha$. The probability of correctly rejecting a false null is called *power* and denoted by $\\text{Power} = 1 - \\beta = 1 -  Prob(\\text{Type II Error})$. \n\nSignificance is often chosen by statistical analysts to be $\\alpha=0.05$. Power is less often chosen, instead following from a decision about power.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip icon=false collapse=\"true\"}\nThe code below runs a small simulation using a shifted, nonparametric bootstrap.

Generally, power depends on the effect size and sample size: bigger true effects and larger $n$ make it easier to detect real differences (higher power, lower $\\beta$).\n\n\n\n\n",
