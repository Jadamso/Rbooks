# Introduction to Data Analysis

This section introduces basic statistics from a computational rather than mathematical approach. We will use some basic probability theory, which you can review at the [high-school level](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-seventh-grade-math/cc-7th-probability-statistics) if this is not familiar to you. We will also use R statistical software, which you will be introduced to in the first chapter.
