# Random Variables
***

In the last section we computed a distribution given the data, whereas now we generate individual data points given the distribution. 

Random variables are variables whose values occur according to a frequency distribution. As such, random variables have a

* *sample space* which refers to the set of all possible outcomes, and
* *probability* for each particular set of outcomes, which is the proportion that those outcomes occur in the long run. 

We think of a data generating process before the data are actually observed. For example, we consider flipping a coin before knowing whether it lands on heads or tails. We denote the random variable, in this case the unflipped coin, as $X_{i}$, and the specific values it can take as $x$ ($x=1$ is heads, $x=0$ is tails) and the probability of each outcome is $1/2$. This differs from a flipped coin that is either heads or tails, and denoted as $\hat{X}_{i}$.

There are two basic types of sample spaces: discrete (encompassing cardinal-discrete, factor-ordered, and factor-unordered data) and continuous. This leads to two types of random variables: discrete and continuous. However, each type has many different 
[probability distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_probability_distributions).

#### **Probability**. {-}
The most common random variables are [easily accessible](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Distributions.html) and can be described using the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
\begin{eqnarray}
F(x) &=& Prob(X_{i} \leq x).
\end{eqnarray}
Note that this is just like the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF), $\hat{F}(x)$, except that it is now theoretically known. You can think of $F(x)$ as the ECDF for a dataset with an infinite number of observations. Equivalently, the ECDF is an empirical version of the CDF that is applied to observed data.

After introducing different random variables, we will also cover some basic implications of their CDF. Intuitively, probabilities must sum up to one. So we can compute $Prob(X_{i} > x) = 1- F(x)$. We also have two "in" and "out" probabilities.

The probability of $X_{i}\leq b$ and $X_{i}> a$ can be written in terms of falling into a range $Prob(X_{i} \in [a,b])=Prob(a < X_{i} \leq b) = F(b) - F(a)$. 

The opposite probability of $X_{i} > b$ or $X_{i} < a$ is $Prob(X_{i} < a \text{ or } X_{i} > b) = F(a) + [1- F(b)]$. Notice that this opposite probability $F(a) + [1- F(b)] =1 - [F(b) - F(a)]$, so that $Prob(X_{i} \text{ out of } [a,b]) = 1 - Prob( X_{i} \in [a,b])$


## Discrete
A discrete random variable can take one of several values in a set. E.g., any number in $\{1,2,3,...\}$ or any letter in $\{A,B,C,...\}$. Theoretical proportions are referred to as a *probability mass function*, which can be thought of as a proportions bar plot for an infinitely large dataset. Equivalently, the bar plot is an empirical version of the probability mass function that is applied to observed data.

In R, you can simulate random discrete data using the `sample` function. To do so, you must specify each outcome $x$ and its probability $Prob(X_{i}=x)$.

#### **Bernoulli**. {-}
Think of a Coin Flip: Heads or Tails with equal probability. In general, a Bernoulli random variable denotes heads as the event $x=1$ and tails as the event $x=0$, and allows the probability of heads to vary $p \in [0,1]$.
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& \{0,1\} \\
Prob(X_{i} =0) &=& 1-p \\
Prob(X_{i} =1) &=& p \\
F(x) &=& \begin{cases}
    0   & x<0 \\
    1-p & x \in [0,1) \\
    1   & x\geq 1
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

Here is an example of the [Bernoulli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution) distribution. While you might get all heads (or all tails) in the first few coin flips, the ratios level out to their theoretical values after many flips.
```{r}
x <- c(0,1)
x_probs <- c(3/4, 1/4)

sample(x, 1, prob=x_probs, replace=T) # 1 Flip
sample(x, 4, prob=x_probs, replace=T) # 4 Flips 
X0 <- sample(x, 400, prob=x_probs, replace=T)

# Plot Cumulative Proportion
X0_t <- seq(1, length(X0)) #head(X0_t)
X0_mt <- cumsum(X0)/X0_t #head(X0_mt)
par(mar=c(4,4,1,4))
plot(X0_t, X0_mt, type='l',
    ylab='Cumulative Proportion (p)',
    xlab='Flip #', 
    ylim=c(0,1), 
    lwd=2)
# Show individual flip outcomes
points(X0_t, X0, col=grey(0,.5),
    pch='|', cex=.3)
# Show theoretical proportions
abline(h=0.25, col='blue')

# Plot Long run proportions
proportions <- table(X0)/length(X0)
plot(proportions, 
    col=grey(0, 0.5),
    xlab='Flip Outcome', 
    ylab='Proportion',
    main=NA)
points(c(0,1), c(.75, .25), pch=16, col='blue') # Theoretical values

# Plot CDF
plot( ecdf(X0), col=grey(0,.5),
    pch=16, main=NA) #Empirical
#points(c(0,1), c(.75, 1), pch=16, col='blue') # Theoretical
```


#### **Discrete Uniform**. {-}
Discrete numbers with equal probability, such as a die with $K$ sides. 
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& \{1,...K\} \\
Prob(X_{i} =1) &=& Prob(X_{i} =2) = ... = 1/K\\
F(x) &=& \begin{cases}
    0   & x<1 \\
    1/K & x \in [1,2) \\
    2/K & x \in [2,3) \\
    \vdots & \\
    1   & x\geq K
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
Here is an example with $K=4$. E.g., rolling a four-sided die.

The probability of a value smaller than or equal to $3$ is $Prob(X_{i} \leq 3)=1/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 3/4$.

The probability of a value larger than $3$ is $Prob(X_{i} > 3) = 1-Prob(X_{i} \leq 3)=1/4$.

The probability of a value $>$ 1 and $\leq 3$ is $Prob(1 < X_{i} \leq 3) = Prob(X_{i} \leq 3) - Prob(X_{i} \leq 1) = 3/4 - 1/4 = 2/4$.^[This is the general formula using CDFs, and you can verify it works in this instance by directly adding the probability of each 2 or 3 event: $Prob(X_{i} = 2) +  Prob(X_{i} = 3) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 2/4$.]

The probability of a value $\leq$ 1 or $> 3$ is $Prob(X_{i} \leq 1 \text{ or } X_{i} > 3) =  Prob(X_{i} \leq 1) +  \left[ 1- Prob(X_{i} \leq 3) \right] = 1/4 + [1 - 3/4]=2/4$.
:::

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
x_probs <- c(1/4, 1/4, 1/4, 1/4)
# sample(x, 1, prob=x_probs, replace=T) # 1 roll
X1 <- sample(x, 2000, prob=x_probs, replace=T) # 2000 rolls

# Plot Long run proportions
proportions <- table(X1)/length(X1)
plot(proportions, col=grey(0,.5),
    xlab='Outcome', ylab='Proportion', main=NA)
points(x, x_probs, pch=16, col='blue') # Theoretical values

# Hist w/ Theoretical Counts

# points(x, x_probs*length(X1), pch='-') 

# Alternative Plot

# Alternative Plot 2
#props <- table(X1)
#barplot(props, ylim = c(0, 0.35), ylab = "Proportion", xlab = "Value")
#abline(h = 1/4, lty = 2)
```
        
Note that the [Discrete Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution) distribution generalizes to arbitrary intervals, although we will not exploit the generalization in this class.

#### **Multinoulli (aka Categorical)**. {-}
Numbers $1,...K$ with unequal probabilities.
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& \{1,...K\} \\
Prob(X_{i} =1) &=& p_{1} \\
Prob(X_{i} =2) &=& p_{2} \\
        &\vdots& \\
p_{1} + p_{2} + ... &=& 1\\
F(x) &=& \begin{cases}
    0   & x<1 \\
    p_{1} & x \in [1,2) \\
    p_{1} + p_{2} & x \in [2,3) \\
    \vdots & \\
    1   & x\geq K
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

Here is an empirical example with three outcomes

```{r}
x <- c('A', 'B', 'C')
x_probs <- c(3/10, 1/10, 6/10)
sum(x_probs)
X2 <- sample(x, 2000, prob=x_probs, replace=T) # sample of 2000

# Plot Long run proportions
proportions <- table(X2)/length(X2)
plot(proportions, col=grey(0,.5),
    xlab='Outcome', ylab='Proportion', main=NA)
points(x, x_probs, pch=16, col='blue') # Theoretical values

# Histogram version
# X2_alt <- X1
# X2_alt[X2_alt=='A'] <- 1
#X2_alt[X2_alt=='B'] <- 2
#X2_alt[X2_alt=='C'] <- 3
#X2_alt <- as.numeric(X1_alt)
#hist(X2_alt, breaks=50, border=NA, 
#    main=NA, ylab='Count')
#points(x, x_probs*length(X2_alt), pch=16) ## Theoretical Counts

# Alternative Plot
# plot( ecdf(X2), pch=16, col=grey(0,.5), main=NA)
```

We can also replace numbers with letters $(A,...Z)$ or names $(John, Jamie, ...)$ although we must be careful with the CDF when there is no longer a natural ordering. The CDF $F(x)=Pr(X_{i} \leq x)$ requires an ordering on the outcomes. With labels like $A,B,C$ you can impose alphabetical ordering and everything works. With labels like "my car dies" and "it rains next Tuesday", you do not have any inherent order and the CDF is an arbitrary artifact.


:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
Suppose there is an experiment with three possible outcomes, $\{A, B, C\}$. It was repeated $50$ times and discovered that $A$ occurred $10$ times, $B$ occurred $13$ times, and $C$ occurred $27$ times. The estimated probability of each outcome is found via the bar plot $\hat{p}_{A} = 10/50$, $\hat{p}_{B} = 13/50$, $\hat{p}_{A} = 27/50$.
We can also estimate the "in" probabilities as $\hat{Prob}(A \text{ or } B)=10/50+13/50=23/50$ and $\hat{Prob}(B \text{ or } C)=13/50+27/50=40/50$, as well as the "out" probability as $\hat{Prob}(A \text{ or } C)=13/50+27/50=37/50$.

Suppose there are three possible outcomes of an experiment, $\{\text{my car dies}, \text{it rains next Tuesday},\text{a cat is born}\}$, which have corresponding probabilities $\{3/10, 1/10, 6/10 \}$ that are known theoretically. Compute the probability that my car dies or a cat is born.

## Continuous
A continuous random variable can take one value out of an uncountably infinite number. E.g., any number between $0$ and $1$ with any number of decimal points. With a continuous random variable, the probability of any individual point is zero, so we describe these variables with the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F$, or the probability density function (PDF), $f$. Just as $F$ can be thought of as the ECDF, $\hat{F}$, with an infinite amount of data, $f$ can be thought of as a histogram, $\hat{f}$, with an infinite amount of data.  Equivalently, the histogram is an empirical version of the PDF that is applied to observed data.

Often, the PDF helps you intuitively understand a random variable whereas the CDF helps you calculate numerical values. This is because probabilities are depicted as areas in the PDF and the CDF accumulates those areas: $F(x)$ equals the area under the PDF from $-\infty$ to $x$. For example, $Prob(X_{i} \leq 1)$ is depicted by the PDF as the area under $f(x)$ from the lowest possible value until $x=1$, which is numerically calculated simply as $F(1)$.


In R, you work with continuous distributions these using functions

* `dXXX` density, $f(x)$ for particular values $x$
* `pXXX` distribution, $F(x)$ for particular values $x$
* `rXXX` random draws, $\hat{X}_{i}$ drawn randomly from `pXXX`

where `XXX` is the distribution name (`unif`, `exp`, `norm`)

#### **Continuous Uniform**. {-}
Any number on a unit interval allowing for any number of decimal points, with every interval of the same size having the same probability.
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& [0,1] \\
f(x) &=& \begin{cases}
    1 & x \in [0,1] \\
    0 & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}\\
F(x) &=& \begin{cases} 
    0 & x < 0 \\
    x & x \in [0,1] \\
    1 & x > 1.
\end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

:::{.callout-note icon=false collapse="true"}
The probability of a value being exactly $0.25$ is $Prob(X_{i} =0.25)=0$.

The probability of a value smaller than $0.25$ is $F(0.25)=0.25$.

The probability of a value larger than $0.25$ is $1-F(0.25)=0.75$.

The probability of a value in $(0.25,0.75]$ is $Prob(0.25 < X_{i} \leq 0.75) = Prob(X_{i} \leq 0.75) - Prob(X_{i} \leq 0.25) = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5$. 

The probability of a value in $(0.2,0.7]$ is $Prob(0.2 < X_{i} \leq 0.7) = Prob(X_{i} \leq 0.7) - \left[ 1- Prob(X_{i} \leq 0.2) \right] = 0.7 - 0.2 = 0.5$.

The probability of a value outside of $(0.2,0.7]$ is $Prob(X_{i} \leq 0.2 \text{ or } x > 0.7) = 0.2 + [1-0.7]=0.5$. Alternatively, you can compute $1- Prob(0.2 < X_{i} \leq 0.7)=1-0.5=0.5$.

```{r}
# Prob. < 0.25
punif(0.25)

# Prob. > 0.25

F_in <- F_two[2] - F_two[1]

Note that the [Continuous Uniform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution) distribution generalizes to an arbitrary interval, $X_{i} \in [a,b]$. In this case, $f(x)=1/[b-a]$ if $x \in [a,b]$ and $F(x)=[x-a]/[b-a]$ if $x \in [a,b]$.

Suppose $X_{i}$ is a random variable continuously distributed over $a=-2$ and $b=2$. What is the probability of a value smaller than $0.25$? First use the computer to suggest an answer: simulate $1000$ draws and then make a histogram and an ECDF. Then find the answer mathematically using the CDF. Finally, verify the answer is intuitively correct in a figure of the PDF. You should draw by hand both the CDF and the PDF with correct axes labels and marking clearly the probability of a value smaller than $0.25$.

#### **Exponential**. {-}
The sample space is any positive number.^[In other classes, you may further distinguish types of random variables based on whether their maximum value is theoretically finite or infinite.] An [Exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution) random variable has a single parameter, $\lambda>0$, that governs its shape
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& [0,\infty) \\
f(x) &=& \lambda exp\left\{ -\lambda x \right\} \\
F(x) &=& \begin{cases} 
    0 & x < 0 \\
    1-  exp\left\{ -\lambda x \right\} & x \geq 0.

#### **Normal (Gaussian)**. {-}
This distribution is for any number on the real line, with bell shaped probabilities. The [Normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) distribution is mathematically complex and sometimes called the Gaussian distribution. We call it "Normal" because we will encounter it again and again and again. The probability density function $f$ has two parameters $\mu \in (-\infty,\infty)$ and $\sigma > 0$.
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{i} &\in& (-\infty,\infty) \\
f(x) &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} exp\left\{ \frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right\}
