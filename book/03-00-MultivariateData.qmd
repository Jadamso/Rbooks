# Introduction to Linear Regression

This section introduces linear regression models from the perspective that ``all models are wrong, but some are useful''. All linear models are estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). For more in-depth introductions, which typically begin by assuming a linear data generating process, see https://jadamso.github.io/Rbooks/ordinary-least-squares.html#more-literature.
